          Cypress is the rigorous and repeatable testing tool of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and EHR modules in calculating Advanced Care Information (ACI) Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs). The Cypress tool is open source and freely available for use or adoption by the health IT community including EHR vendors and Authorized Testing Labs. Cypress serves as the official testing tool for the 2016 EHR Certification program supported by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC).

        <p>Cypress tests four different certification criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Capture and Export - the ability of EHR technology to capture clinical data and export it in a format usable by other EHRs</li>
          <li>Import and Calculate - the ability of EHR technology to import data from other EHRs and perform CQM calculations</li>
          <li>Submission - the ability of EHR technology to create a standard data file that can be electronically submitted to Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services (CMS)</li>
          <li>Filtering - the ability of EHR technology to filter clinical data based on different data types</li>

    </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
          The Cypress software includes a standard test data of synthetic patient records that exercises all of the ACI CQMs, for Eligible Professionals (EP) and Eligible Hospitals (EH). The Cypress test data is available in standard formats (XML and HTML). Testers download data from Cypress, manipulate it with the EHR technology, and upload the results to Cypress for validation. Cypress then provides a report of any errors detected in the uploaded results. Testing may be performed manually or through an API (see the Cypress API documentation for more information).
