Cypress is the rigorous and repeatable testing tool of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and EHR modules in calculating Meaningful Use (MU) Stage 2 Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs). The Cypress tool is open source and freely available for use or adoption by the health IT community including EHR vendors and testing labs.
